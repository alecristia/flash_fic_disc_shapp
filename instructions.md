### How to use this site

This is a shiny app for self-guided discovery of flash fiction.

Each story contains the transcript of a person, interviewed in the 
context of a crime. Your job is to figure out who did what and how
one can be sure.

To begin, choose a story from the drop-down menu on the left.
Then type in some text to start discovering it. Up to five
lines containing the text you typed will be displayed,
together with the number of line in which they appeared.

The table also tells you whether you've seen a line before (new=
TRUE) or not (i.e., you had a new hit this time).


When you are ready to guess the crime, culprit, and a word that
proved the person's guilt (either a piece of evidence or the
word "confession"), enter them. 

You'll see at the top whether you guessed right.

Don't change story before you figure it out! Your progress won't be saved.

And if you'd like to contribute your own story, submit it here:
